                    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Emmanuel Amoh, and I am a rising junior attending the University of New Haven. I am majoring in Computer Science with
                    a concentration in cybersecurity.</p>
                    <p>My coding journey began during the summer of 2017 when I happened to be on my computer and needed something to keep me busy. I stumbled
                    upon Khanacademy and looked into their p5.js programming course. Here, I learned how to use var ables and built-in functions to render shapes, colors,
                    and my own quick animations on the canvas. I was immediately hooked! I would spend hours and hours without leaving my seat, creating evening city buildings
                    with a growing moon and stars (they don't really look like stars, but I tried okay) to creating a house and other scenery you would typically see in an animated show.
                    Eager to learn more, I used Codecademy to learn HTML and CSS within about 2 months and the rest is history.</p>
                    <p>From then on, I've had a growing passion in web technology, the workings of the internet and its vast network, the web security and protocols, and the
                    web development that goes into processing user data and storing it into databases. For the rest of high-school, I would work on web design projects (without using templates)
                    to practice and see what I could make with the skills that I've gained. At the end of my senior year of high school, I've worked with a friend to create a coding club website
                    for our school. Starting the fall of 2019, I embarked on my Computer Science degree, taking programming courses and understanding what back-end development consists of. I've taken
                    courses from Data Structures and Algorithms to Database and SQL to Java Programming, and working on projects for these courses to further my knowledge in what it means to develop
                    a web application. Taking on a cybersecurity concentration, my goal is to attain a deeper understanding of security when it comes to using the web and using our own devices.
                    I'm hoping I can somehow use this knowledge to create innovative solutions to issues facing secure technology.</p>

                <h3>My Career Path</h3>
                <div class= "text path">
                    <p>Originally, I just wanted to be a software developer. But what I realized was that there are specific software development roles like front-end development or mobile development.
                    After doing some thinking about what I see myself enjoying the most, I have decided to pursue the Full-Stack development track. I love being creative with front-end resources and
                    I find it fun to be the one to design the UI for websites users will always interact with. I also love being challenged and solving problems that arise that will need technical
                    skills to overcome. Back-end developement is the fun type of challenge where developers work with user data and interact with databases and APIs to control the flow of information.
                    Keeoping these two things in mind, I think that the Full-Stack Developer position fits best for what I'm looking for. I will also have the skills of a front-end and back-end developer
                    so I can also switch between the two and still do what I love!</p>
                    <p>To prepare, I'm brushing up on my HTML and CSS, as well as going deeper with JavaScript and learning about classes, asynchronous functions, and promises. I'll also be working on
                    another school project with some high school coding buddies to help further our high school's stress on academics and being a hardworking student with rewards. Creating a store front
                    is something I've never done before, but nevertheless, I'm excited to see what I can create with my team. I'm also learning more Python than the fundamentals so I can add more languages
                    to the list of skills I am proficient in.</p>
