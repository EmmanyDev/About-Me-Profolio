# About-Me-Profolio
A personal project to provide resources to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram pages. Also include a page that talks about who I am

This is my technical profolio project. Here, I have created a web serivce which allows the visitor to visit either my GitHub, LinkedIn, or Instagram profile. The visual presenation of the site itself is supposed to display my knowledge in HTML and CSS, and my strong interest in web development. I have also created an About page which displays some information about who I am and where I am in my career path. (As of May 29th, 2021, the about page is currently incomplete and will be completed soon :) )

NOTE: All of the code was written purely by me for the exception of the box-shadow and linear-gradient values for the CSS properties, which I got from box-shadow and linear-gradient generators, respectively.

If you are a recruiter or a current developer, I hope you enjoy my design. I know I have a long way to go, but this is just the beginning.

If you are a student and are interested in getting into the tech industry, I highly suggest learning how to make a website first, using HTML and CSS, along with JavaScript. From here, you can learn and do anything you want, as long as you put your mind to it.

Happy coding! :D
